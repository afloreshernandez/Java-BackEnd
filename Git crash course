Crash course on git

1. Checkout a new branch
2. make changes to your new branch to add a new feature. making frequent commits along the way.
3. push your commits any time they reach a point you think others should be able to see them.
4. once your feature is done merge your branch into the master branch. If yu get merge conflicts you need to resolve them. I am not sure how to do that though.
